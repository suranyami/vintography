          <p>
            'Vintographers' David Jenkins, Jill Lacina, Tony Peri and Kirsten Spry follow in the footsteps of the earliest photographers, using vintage image-making processes to create modern artworks.
          </p>
          <p>
            These 'alternative' photographers will discuss their contemporary photographs hand-made from digital and film cameras as salt prints, cyanotypes, wet-plate collodion 'Tintypes', and photogravures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tony Peri will demonstrate one of these techniques, by making a bromoil print (oil pigment photograph).
          </p>

          <h2><span class="highlight">Kirsten's</span> Lucky Charms</h2>
          <p>
            Kirsten Spry is very excited to reveal that her cyanotype series, Lucky Charms, is being exhibited by major record label EMI as part of their Art Project. The images will be shown in the Flinders Street-facing windows of EMI’s new offices in Surry Hills from 20 Sept for 6-8 weeks.
          </p>

          <h2><span class="highlight">Primrose Park</span> Artists on Show</h2>
          <p>
            Kirsten will also be on show with work by Tony Peri, David Jenkins &amp; Jill Lacina at the Manly Art Gallery on Thursday 20 September from 6-8pm. The four Primrose Park Photographers were invited to the gallery following on from their successful &lsquo;VINTOGRAPHY&rsquo; exhibition in the HeadOn Photography Festival in May earlier this year. They will be showing a selection of hand-made photographs using alternative &amp; historic printing processes and talking about their methods, materials and ideas behind their work. Many works will be out of frames and seen up close.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a special treat, the gallery has invited Tony to make a bromoil, on site, on the night, alongside an original Harold Cazneaux bromoil that the gallery has in its collection. So you will be able to get an insight into this beautiful process whilst seeing a vintage work from one of Australia&rsquo;s fathers of photography. The gang will discuss their contemporary photographs hand-made from digital &amp; film cameras as salt prints, cyanotypes, wet-plate collodion 'Tintypes', bromoils and photogravures. Come along if you can.

            <h2><span class="highlight">Artist Profile:</span> Kirsten Spry</h2>
            <p>
              Kirsten Spry is a Sydney photographer who is interested in
              alternative photographic techniques, including cameraless
              photography. It&rsquo;s not as contradictory as it sounds. The
              techniques she uses can be traced back to photography&rsquo;s early
              beginnings: mixing chemicals and coating paper to make it sensitive
              to light, using the sun instead of an enlarger, and placing objects
              on the paper to record their image &ndash; no camera in sight. The
              historic processes she uses include photograms, cyanotypes, and salt
              prints. But she&rsquo;s not a total purist. She also throws some
              technology into the mix by using a digital camera and digital
              darkroom (Photoshop). &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very hung up on megapixels
              or lenses; I&rsquo;ve found a scanner does quite nicely sometimes
              instead of a camera, and just a lens cap with a pin-hole in it can
              make for a lovely lens. The final print is more hand-crafted.

            <h3><span class="highlight">Series:</span> Lucky Charm (Cyanotypes)</h3>
            <p>
              The images in Kirsten Spry&rsquo;s Lucky Charm (2011) series are all
              cyanotypes. The English scientist and astronomer Sir John Herschel
              discovered the cyanotype procedure in 1842. He considered it as a
              means of reproducing notes and diagrams, as in blueprints. It was
              Anna Atkins, a botanist and photographer, who applied this process to
              photography in 1843. She had learned directly from William Henry Fox
              Talbot his &quot;photogenic drawing&quot; or &ldquo;photogram&rdquo;
              technique (in which an object is placed on light-sensitized paper
              which is exposed to the sun to produce an image). She combined the
              two processes by placing plant specimens on paper coated using the
              cyanotype method, using sunlight to create a sillhouette of the
              plant, and in doing so became the very first female photographer.
              Atkins is also considered the first person to publish a book
              illustrated with photographic images.
            </p>

            <p>
              Following in Atkins footsteps, Kirsten has produced this cyanotype
              series, taking it a step forward by experimenting with what she calls
              &ldquo;double exposure&rdquo; cyanotypes. These images are sun prints
              that show two cyanotype images in one artwork. They have been created
              by coating the paper a second time after the first image is achieved.
              The first image used a lith photogram, and the second, a digital
              negative. The differences in the blue tone are due to variations in
              the strength of the sunlight on the days the images were made. About
              this series, Kirsten says: &ldquo;If you saw these images in a dream
              they would herald success of some kind. What you see in daily life
              imprints itself in your mind&rsquo;s eye. I hope that by looking at
              these images, the image will reappear in your dreams, providing a
              lucky charm for future endeavours.&rdquo;

            <h3><span class="highlight">Series:</span> Salt Prints of Sea Pools</h3>
            <p>
              William Henry Fox Talbot, known as &ldquo;The Father of Modern
              Photography&rdquo;, invented the salted paper process in 1833, while
              he was on his honeymoon. He was the first to make a silver image on
              paper. On his first attempts, paper coated with a silver nitrate
              solution and exposed to light only gave a faint metallic silver
              image. He later discovered that by first applying salt to the paper
              and then coating it with the silver nitrate solution he could get a
              much stronger image. This is basically the same way that Kirsten Spry
              has made this series of salt prints &mdash; only she&rsquo;s added a
              few tweaks, including toning each print in gold (gold chloride), to
              grant permanence to the image.
            </p>
            <p>
              While photography&rsquo;s pioneers were slogging it out with toxic
              chemicals in primitive darkrooms, early out-doorsy Sydney-siders were
              enjoying the delights of ocean baths and pools. There are about 100
              sea pools in NSW today, some are natural depressions or rings of
              rocks, some are indigenous fishing spots (or bogey holes), and others
              are hewn out of rock platforms or built with concrete to form a
              swimming pool. Inspired by these unique pools in their magnificent
              settings, Kirsten Spry has created this series: Salt Prints of Sea
              Pools. &ldquo;This series reflects my love and awe of the ocean. The
              images portray a new interpretation of our of our world-renown beach
              culture,&rdquo; she says.

              The works appearing in the &lsquo;Vintography&rsquo; exhibition
              consist of two different bodies of work, both incorporating the
              same medium of photogravure. Images are etched onto the
              photopolymer with UV light.

            <p>
              The Snow series explores the simplicity of flora in a winter
              landscape. Often overlooked because of the starkness, these images
              echo the solitude and serenity of the season. The inks used create
              a feeling of another era, a seemingly historical record of the
              present.

            <p>
              Forest for the Trees is a whimsical series of prints standing in
              contrast with the Snow series in its exploration of colour. These
              prints also began as photograms where the shadows of plant objects
              were first exposed onto film. The photograms where then used to
              etch shapes onto the photopolymer plant. This series was an
              opportunity to experiment with using multiple plates and multiple
              colours. The variations are endless.

            <p>
              Tony Peri is an artisan. He plays marine band harmonicas the way
              they were made in the 1850s. He listens to 19th Century village
              folk music from eastern Europe. And he makes bromoils, tintypes,
              cyanotypes, polaroids and custom B&amp;W photographs in his
              darkroom studio in Sydney, using vintage brass lenses and wooden
              cameras. His photographs are timeless. His work is that of an
              artist. Made with depth, heart &amp; soul. The printing process is
              created like a jazz instrumental. Fine tuned and fully improvised.
              This is photography. Unique. And it speaks&hellip;

              Tony Peri has been following the Australian-Hungarian Folklore
              Ensemble, documenting the folk traditions, music and dance from Hungary,
              Romania and Transylvania. This photo is of musician Peter Sackett from
              the Western Australian band 'Hot Paprika'.

            <h3><span class="highlight">Series:</span> Hungary</h3>
            <p>
              In this Vintography exhibition Tony Peri is making new bromoils of
              Hungary and Hungarian folk musicians. A bromoil is a vintage
              photographic process whereby a silver photograph is converted into
              an oil pigment photograph, all hand-made with beautiful papers,
              brushes and ink. The process dates back to 1908. Each bromoil is
              archival, like an oil painting, and quite beautiful to see in
              real-life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tony exhibits his fine art B&amp;W photographs regularly in
              galleries and festivals around Australia. He works as a
              photographer, teaches photography workshops and is an active member
              of the Primrose Park Photography club &mdash; one of the few
              non-competitive photography clubs in Australia.
