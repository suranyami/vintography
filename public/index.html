          <h2><span class="highlight">Artist Profile:</span> Kirsten Spry</h2>
          <p>
            Kirsten Spry is a Sydney photographer who is interested in 
            alternative photographic techniques, including cameraless 
            photography. It&rsquo;s not as contradictory as it sounds. The 
            techniques she uses can be traced back to photography&rsquo;s early 
            beginnings: mixing chemicals and coating paper to make it sensitive 
            to light, using the sun instead of an enlarger, and placing objects 
            on the paper to record their image &ndash; no camera in sight. The 
            historic processes she uses include photograms, cyanotypes, and salt 
            prints. But she&rsquo;s not a total purist. She also throws some 
            technology into the mix by using a digital camera and digital 
            darkroom (Photoshop). &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very hung up on megapixels 
            or lenses; I&rsquo;ve found a scanner does quite nicely sometimes 
            instead of a camera, and just a lens cap with a pin-hole in it can 
            make for a lovely lens. The final print is more hand-crafted.

          <h3><span class="highlight">Series:</span> Lucky Charm (Cyanotypes)</h3>
          <p>
            The images in Kirsten Spry&rsquo;s Lucky Charm (2011) series are all 
            cyanotypes. The English scientist and astronomer Sir John Herschel 
            discovered the cyanotype procedure in 1842. He considered it as a 
            means of reproducing notes and diagrams, as in blueprints. It was 
            Anna Atkins, a botanist and photographer, who applied this process to 
            photography in 1843. She had learned directly from William Henry Fox 
            Talbot his &quot;photogenic drawing&quot; or &ldquo;photogram&rdquo; 
            technique (in which an object is placed on light-sensitized paper 
            which is exposed to the sun to produce an image). She combined the 
            two processes by placing plant specimens on paper coated using the 
            cyanotype method, using sunlight to create a sillhouette of the 
            plant, and in doing so became the very first female photographer. 
            Atkins is also considered the first person to publish a book 
            illustrated with photographic images.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following in Atkins footsteps, Kirsten has produced this cyanotype 
            series, taking it a step forward by experimenting with what she calls 
            &ldquo;double exposure&rdquo; cyanotypes. These images are sun prints 
            that show two cyanotype images in one artwork. They have been created 
            by coating the paper a second time after the first image is achieved. 
            The first image used a lith photogram, and the second, a digital 
            negative. The differences in the blue tone are due to variations in 
            the strength of the sunlight on the days the images were made. About 
            this series, Kirsten says: &ldquo;If you saw these images in a dream 
            they would herald success of some kind. What you see in daily life 
            imprints itself in your mind&rsquo;s eye. I hope that by looking at 
            these images, the image will reappear in your dreams, providing a 
            lucky charm for future endeavours.&rdquo;

          <h3><span class="highlight">Series:</span> Salt Prints of Sea Pools</h3>
          <p>
            William Henry Fox Talbot, known as &ldquo;The Father of Modern 
            Photography&rdquo;, invented the salted paper process in 1833, while 
            he was on his honeymoon. He was the first to make a silver image on 
            paper. On his first attempts, paper coated with a silver nitrate 
            solution and exposed to light only gave a faint metallic silver 
            image. He later discovered that by first applying salt to the paper 
            and then coating it with the silver nitrate solution he could get a 
            much stronger image. This is basically the same way that Kirsten Spry 
            has made this series of salt prints &mdash; only she&rsquo;s added a 
            few tweaks, including toning each print in gold (gold chloride), to 
            grant permanence to the image.
          </p>
          <p>
            While photography&rsquo;s pioneers were slogging it out with toxic 
            chemicals in primitive darkrooms, early out-doorsy Sydney-siders were 
            enjoying the delights of ocean baths and pools. There are about 100 
            sea pools in NSW today, some are natural depressions or rings of 
            rocks, some are indigenous fishing spots (or bogey holes), and others 
            are hewn out of rock platforms or built with concrete to form a 
            swimming pool. Inspired by these unique pools in their magnificent 
            settings, Kirsten Spry has created this series: Salt Prints of Sea 
            Pools. &ldquo;This series reflects my love and awe of the ocean. The 
            images portray a new interpretation of our of our world-renown beach 
            culture,&rdquo; she says.

          <p>
            The Snow series explores the simplicity of flora in a winter 
            landscape. Often overlooked because of the starkness, these images 
            echo the solitude and serenity of the season. The inks used create 
            a feeling of another era, a seemingly historical record of the 
            present.

          <h3><span class="highlight">Series:</span> Forest for the Trees</h3>
          <p>
            Forest for the Trees is a whimsical series of prints standing in 
            contrast with the Snow series in its exploration of colour. These 
            prints also began as photograms where the shadows of plant objects 
            were first exposed onto film. The photograms where then used to 
            etch shapes onto the photopolymer plant. This series was an 
            opportunity to experiment with using multiple plates and multiple 
            colours. The variations are endless.

          <p>
            Tony Peri is an artisan. He plays marine band harmonicas the way 
            they were made in the 1850s. He listens to 19th Century village 
            folk music from eastern Europe. And he makes bromoils, tintypes, 
            cyanotypes, polaroids and custom B&amp;W photographs in his 
            darkroom studio in Sydney, using vintage brass lenses and wooden 
            cameras. His photographs are timeless. His work is that of an 
            artist. Made with depth, heart &amp; soul. The printing process is 
            created like a jazz instrumental. Fine tuned and fully improvised. 
            This is photography. Unique. And it speaks&hellip;

              Tony Peri has been following the Australian-Hungarian Folklore
              Ensemble, documenting the folk traditions, music and dance from Hungary,
              Romania and Transylvania. This photo is of musician Peter Sackett from
              the Western Australian band 'Hot Paprika'.

          <p>            
            In this Vintography exhibition Tony Peri is making new bromoils of 
            Hungary and Hungarian folk musicians. A bromoil is a vintage 
            photographic process whereby a silver photograph is converted into 
            an oil pigment photograph, all hand-made with beautiful papers, 
            brushes and ink. The process dates back to 1908. Each bromoil is 
            archival, like an oil painting, and quite beautiful to see in 
            real-life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tony exhibits his fine art B&amp;W photographs regularly in 
            galleries and festivals around Australia. He works as a 
            photographer, teaches photography workshops and is an active member 
            of the Primrose Park Photography club &mdash; one of the few 
            non-competitive photography clubs in Australia.
